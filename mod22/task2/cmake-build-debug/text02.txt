Develop the simplest text file viewer. At the beginning of the program, the user 
enters the path to the text file that you want to open and view. The internals of the 
file must be output to standard output. The program should work for any text files 
in the TXT format, but you can also create your own separate file for the test. The
main thing is that the file should be in English, in order to avoid problems with 
encodings.
